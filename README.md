# Samsung Galaxy S4 Sound Pack

# About
This Magisk Module replaces your stock sound effects on your Android device with the ones provided on a Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone. This module was originally forked from the [miui-10-sounds](https://www.github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/miui-10-sounds) module.

# Installation
Download the .ZIP file from the [Releases section](https://gitlab.com/Plexer0/samsung-galaxy-s4-sounds/-/releases) and flash it to your device via Magisk Manager.
Compressing manually from source is not recommended.

# Known Bugs
**If you have found a bug or a problem that's not listed here, please file an issue.**

* Some devices won't have all the SFX available, depending on what the individual files are named by default on your ROM. (*You could try forking the repo and renaming them yourself.)
* The global folders are duplicated. This is **__NOT__** a bug. It's a workaround for devices that have slightly different filenames for their default sound folders.

# Changelog
**Ver 1.0:** Initial release
