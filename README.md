# Samsung Galaxy S4 Sound Pack

# About
This Magisk Module replaces your stock sound effects on your Android device with the ones provided on a Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone. This module was originally forked from the [miui-10-sounds](https://www.github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/miui-10-sounds) module.

# Installation
<s>Download the .ZIP file from the [Releases section](https://gitlab.com/Plexer0/samsung-galaxy-s4-sounds/-/releases) and flash it to your device via Magisk Manager.
Compressing manually from source is not recommended.</s>

There are no official releases for development files. (It's just a bunch of sound files in different directories). If you want to try a build out, download the source code in the .zip format and flash it directly.
